;; "choose-reaction-to-input.lisp" (for single gist clause inputs)
;; ===============================================================
;; File for choosing a reaction to a feature-augmented gist
;; clause extracted from a user's answer to a question. In
;; general, the gist clause is expected to provide sufficient
;; information to allow choice of a comment (if warranted) from
;; Lissa, based on choice trees for specific answers, thematic
;; answers, and potentially a final question in the gist
;; clause list.
;;
;; This packet is for single clauses -- see 
;;     "choose-reactions-to-input.lisp"
;; (note the plural) for a packet that makes a choice of a schema
;; depending on multiple gist clauses extracted from the user 
;; input -- but realizing the steps of the schema again depend
;; on the choice packet in this file, and the choice trees 
;; referenced here.
;; 
;; The gist clause input is expected to be of the (at least
;; approximate) form currently constructed by the choice trees
;; for extracting gist clauses from user input, specifically
;; the inputs responsing to the questions (as gist clauses)
;;
;;	How is the weather outside ?
;;  How is the weather forecast for this evening ?
;;  What is your favorite weather ?

  ; Very rough initial attempt.
  ; Actually, it seems we could readily provide reactions
  ; directly here, instead of delegating to specialized
  ; choice trees. However, it seems we have better oversight
  ; by using separate choice trees, specified in a file that
  ; also contains the specialized features for the topic at
  ; issue.
